          <h2>1995 - 1996: THE BIRTH OF JAVASCRIPT</h2>
          <img src="images/1.png" alt="Brendan Eich" />
          <p>
            In 1995, Brendan Eich from Netscape created JavaScript as a
            scripting language for the Netscape Navigator browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea was to allow developers to create more interactive and
            dynamic web pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript was originally called Mocha and then LiveScript before
            finally adopting the name JavaScript.
          </p>

          <h2>1996 - 1999: THE STANDARDIZATION OF JAVASCRIPT</h2>
          <img src="images/7.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            In 1996, JavaScript was standardized for the first time by the
            European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and was called
            ECMAScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            ECMAScript 1 was released in 1997, followed by ECMAScript 2 in 1998.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1999, ECMAScript 3 was released, which became the most widely
            used version of JavaScript for many years.
          </p>

          <h2>2000 - 2005: THE RISE OF AJAX AND JAVASCRIPT LIBRARIES</h2>
          <img src="images/35.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            In the early 2000s, AJAX was developed, allowing web pages to update
            content without reloading the entire page.
          </p>
          <p>
            This led to a greater demand for JavaScript libraries, such as
            jQuery, which simplified writing JavaScript code.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li id="2006 - 2008">
          <h2>2006 - 2008: THE BIRTH OF NODE.JS AND ECMASCRIPT</h2>
          <img src="images/9.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            In 2006, Ryan Dahl created Node.js, allowing developers to use
            JavaScript on the server side.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2008, ECMAScript 5 was released, which added new features to
            JavaScript, such as array methods and native JSON.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li id="2009 - 2014">
          <h2>2009 - 2014: ECMASCRIPT 6 AND THE RISE OF JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS</h2>
          <img src="images/10.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            In 2009, work began on ECMAScript 6, which added features like
            classes and promises.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2010, AngularJS was released, a JavaScript framework developed by
            Google.
          </p>
          <p>This led to the rise of other frameworks like React and Vue.js.</p>
        </li>

        <li id="2015">
          <h2>2015: ECMASCRIPT 2015 AND BEYOND</h2>
          <img src="images/3.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            In 2015, ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) was released, adding features like
            let, const, destructuring, and arrow functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, annual releases of ECMAScript have been launched,
            further improving the language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, JavaScript is used almost everywhere, from web applications
            to mobile and desktop devices.
